# OSCP-WriteUps
Maybe probably not sure, shortened version of write-ups for some machines from LainKusanagis OSCP-Like List 

# MentionedTechniques.md
This file contains all attack vectors from PG section of Lains list. They are not repeated and I attempted to keep them generic / as widely applicable as possible. However there are exceptions like `Postfish` where I deliberately kept them specific. This is mostly due to my skill issues with attacking simulated users on exposed services and mail protocols.
